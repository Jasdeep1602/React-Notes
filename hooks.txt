1.used for website optimization.
2.usememo caches the result or value. 
3.usecallback caches the whole function.
  used so that a function does not impact another function when it is slow.
  unwanted function are called that slow down the rest of the  functions. 


4.useeffect bring a sideeffect when for example a state is changed.

5.useref is basically to refer the html tags by ref attribute other than to use it by document.getElement....

6.useReducer changes the state without using useState. Used when we have a lot of useStates and a be easily passed down to the childrens.

7.useContext Allows to pass data to children without having to pass down prop  manually at every level.

  parent will act as a provider and children will be consumers.
  
  eg...component A has a state which has a property name
 
  data will be send via props like A->B->C->D
this can be time consuming and erreos can be made
