1.2 types of exports 
    -default
    -named for exporting multiple funcs
    -export func......
    -named exports can be imported by using {func,.....}

2.Event Handlers
  1.onClick={()=>{}}


3.Hooks
  -import {useState} from 'react'

  1.useState
    -whenever state variable is changed,the component it is part of will be rerendered and        updated.
    -means it will triggers reconciliation cycle.  
    -maintains state is component.
    -const[state,setState]=useState(defaultValue(state))
    -state variable is received in an array.
    -whenever a state variable changes,react rerenders the component.
    -keeps UI layer in sync with data layer.
    -this is DOM manipulation.

4.Reconciliation Algo(React Fiber)
  -
  -Diff Algo
  -react works on VDOM instead of DOM.
  -finds different between old nd new VDOM on any change made in state.
  -then update the actual DOM on every render cycle.
  -VDOM is actually a object.
