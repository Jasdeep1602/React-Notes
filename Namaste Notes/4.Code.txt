1.Dynamic Component
  -Passing different data to same component.
  -Props(Properties) or arguments or destructure.
  -Using props we can dynamically pass some data to the component.
  -<FC name='' age=''/>
  -Now where the FC code is write
  -const FC=(props)=>{}
  -this is how props are passed.
  -Props is an object.
  -now just access it
  -const FC=(props)=>{return({props.name})}

  -Destructuring
  -const FC=({name,age})=>{return({name})}

2.If we have a lot of props
  -<FC name='' age='' ........../>
  -This can be a problem.
  -We will make a object for the properties. Let..
  -const data={name,age,.......}
  -Then pass it as
  -<FC data={data}/>
  -Then access it like 
  -const FC=(props)=>{return({props.data.name})}

  -map((value,key)=>{return..})
  -If properties is a array of objects then..
  -props.data.map
  

3.Config Driven UI
  -Controlling UI using Config data rather than the hard coded appbase.
  -UI is customized using this as maybe a different UI could be needed for different customer or             regions.
  -diferent data maybe needed for different regions.
