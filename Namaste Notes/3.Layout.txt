  -npx parcel index.html can be shortened.
  -go to scripts is package.json
  -"start":"parcel index.html" for dev
  -"build":"parcel build index.html" for prod
  -now just npm run start or npm start to achieve dev

2.JSX 
  -makes easier to create react elements.
  -JSX is not a part of react.
  -mixture of HTML and JS.
  -its not HTML, it is like HTML.
  -It isnot pure JS.
  -Bundler like parcel transpile JSX to JS(React.createElement) through Babel.
  -So that JS Engine and React can understand it.
  -const jsxHeading = <h1 id='heading'>Hello</h1>
  -attributes are in camel case.
  -code needs to wrapped inside () if it is more that one line.
  -{} inside these you can write any JS expression.

3.React Element
  -const heading=()
  -this can be called in JSX like {heading}
  -


4.React Components

  (A)Function
     -const Heading=()=>{ return}
     -First letter of the F.C component name always uppercase.
     -returns a react element.
     -render it like <Functional Component/> or <FC></FC> or {FC()} .
     -Component inside another Component is COmponent Composition.
